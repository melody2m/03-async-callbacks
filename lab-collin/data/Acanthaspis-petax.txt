Acanthaspis petax is a species of assassin bug that preys on ants and some smaller organism such as beetles and flies. This species uses carcasses of its preferred prey item to disguise itself from predation from spiders in the salticidae family.[1][2][3]

This insect lives in East Africa near Lake Victoria, in countries including Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania.[4] It measures about 1 cm (0.4 in) in length.[citation needed]
